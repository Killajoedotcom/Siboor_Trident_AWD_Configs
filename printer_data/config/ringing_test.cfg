[ringing_test]
size: 150
##   X-Y Size of tower footprint (mm)
height: 60
##   Height of of tower (mm)
band: 5
##   Height for each ringing step (mm)
perimeters: 2
##   Number of perimeters to be printed for the tower
velocity: 80
##   Is the velocity one must use as V in a formula V * N / D when
##   calculating the resonance frequency. N and D are the number of
##   oscillations and the distance between them as usual:
brim_velocity: 30
##   Speed for brim printing in (mm/s)
accel_start: 3000
##   The acceleration of the start of the test
accel_step: 500
##   The increment of the acceleration every `band` (mm/s^2)
layer_height: 0.2
first_layer_height: 0.2
filament_diameter: 1.75

#   Parameters that are computed automatically, but may be adjusted if necessary

center_x: 175
#   Center of the bed by default (if detected correctly)
center_y: 175
#   Center of the bed by default (if detected correctly)
brim_width: 5
#   Computed based on the model size, but may be increased

##   Parameters that are better left at their default values

#notch: 1
##   Size of the notch in mm
#notch_offset:
##  0.275 * size by default
#deceleration_points: 100
