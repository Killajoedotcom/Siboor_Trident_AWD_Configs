accel_chip: adxl345                    # Acceleration chip used
min_freq: 5                            #   Minimum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 5 Hz.
max_freq: 133.33                       #   Maximum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 133.33 Hz.
accel_per_hz: 100
#   This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
#   test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
#   value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
#   a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
#   the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
#   high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
#   (mm/sec).
#   Set it to 60 as a good baseline when using the sweeping resonance tester.
hz_per_sec: 1
#   Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
#   range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
#   hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
#   will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
#   (Hz/sec == sec^-2).
sweeping_accel: 400                    #   An acceleration of slow sweeping moves. The default is 400 mm/sec^2.
sweeping_period: 1.2
#   A period of slow sweeping moves. Avoid setting it to a too small
#   non-zero value in order to not poison the measurements.
#   To enable it, start by setting it to 1.2 sec which is a good all-round
#   choice. Set it to 0 do disable it. The default is 0.
